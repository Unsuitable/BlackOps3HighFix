Hello, just figured out how to do this. Don't worry this won't mess up Black Ops 3.
Basically this file runs every 30 seconds and sets BlackOps3.exe to high priority.
Leave this runnimg in the background once you open it. You can launch it whenever,
during the game, before you launch the game doesn't matter.
